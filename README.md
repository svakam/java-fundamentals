# java-fundamentals
- Contains the first 5-10 labs of Java 401. 
- Files/methods contained within the repo:
  - Basics:
    - Pluralize: accepts a word and a number and returns a string with the word pluralized with an "s", if the number is 0 or greater than 1. 
    - Flipping coins: accepts an integer n and flips coins until n heads are flipped in a row. Simulate coin flipping via random number generator (below .5 = tails, above .5 = heads). Print result per flip, then overall results indicating how many heads per set of flips received. 
    - Command line clock: uses Java's LocalDateTime object to print times to console per second. Program should run until Ctrl+C or presses "Stop" in IDE. 
  - BasicLibrary:
    - Rolling dice: accepts an integer n and "rolls" a 6-sided die n times. Method will return an array containing values of the rolls. 
    - Contains duplicates: returns true or false if an array contains duplicates. 
    - Calculate averages: accepts an array of integers and calculates and returns the average of all the values in an array. 
    - Array of arrays: finds the average of each subarray and returns the array with the lowest average. Uses the function of calculating averages to facilitate this. 
    - Analyze weather data: accepts an array of arrays and tests for lowest average in a given week. 
    - Tally votes: accepts an ArrayList and returns a string that declares the key with the highest associated value. 
    - Linter: make a linter method that lints through JS files to check for semicolons used properly. 
  - Inheritance:
    - Tests our understanding of the concept of inheritance (superclasses, subclasses, etc.). Two classes, Restaurant and Review, are used to add reviews to a restaurant and update the restaurant's rating based on newly added reviews. Reviews are a subclass of a restaurant.
