  - Basics:
    - Pluralize: accepts a word and a number and returns a string with the word pluralized with an "s", if the number is 0 or greater than 1. 
    - Flipping coins: accepts an integer n and flips coins until n heads are flipped in a row. Simulate coin flipping via random number generator (below .5 = tails, above .5 = heads). Print result per flip, then overall results indicating how many heads per set of flips received.

    - Rolling dice: accepts an integer n and "rolls" a 6-sided die n times. Method will return an array containing values of the rolls. 
    - Contains duplicates: returns true or false if an array contains duplicates. 
    - Calculate averages: accepts an array of integers and calculates and returns the average of all the values in an array. 
    - Array of arrays: finds the average of each subarray and returns the array with the lowest average. Uses the function of calculating averages to facilitate this.
